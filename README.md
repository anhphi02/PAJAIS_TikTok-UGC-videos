**Topic: The impact of TikTok UGC videos on online purchase intention: Mediating role of cognitive states**

**Background:** UGC videos have received considerable attention in recent years thanks to their great potential for buyers and sellers; however, the effect of this content on consumer behavior remains unclear, especially in the context of developing countries (e.g., Vietnam). By applying Stimulus - Organism - Response model, this paper examines the effect of UGC videos on online
purchase intention. Moreover, the mediating role of cognitive responses, consisting of perceived credibility, perceived diagnosticity, and mental imagery, is also examined. 

**Method:** A convenience sampling method was employed to collect the data. A total of 318 valid respondents participated in this survey. Data were analysed with the partial least squares-structural equation modelling method (PLS-SEM).

**Results:** The findings show that UGC videos have a direct impact on online purchase intention. This paper also verified that cognitive states mediate the relationship of stimuli and subsequent behavioural intention. 

**Conclusion:** The findings of our study have strong practical implications by informing businesses and marketers the importance of UGC videos with regard to consumer online purchase intention and the critical role of consumersâ€™ cognitive states in online shopping.
